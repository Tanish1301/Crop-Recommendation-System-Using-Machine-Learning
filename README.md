#Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

This project implements a crop recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The system predicts the most suitable crop to cultivate based on input parameters such as soil nutrient levels, temperature, humidity, pH value, rainfall, and geographical location (state).

#How It Works
The system utilizes a machine learning model trained on historical agricultural data to make predictions. The model is trained to classify crops based on their suitability to environmental conditions and soil characteristics.

#Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for implementing the machine learning model and web application.
Flask: Python web framework used to build the web application.
HTML/CSS: Frontend technologies used for designing and styling the user interface.
Pandas, NumPy: Python libraries used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: Python library used for machine learning tasks such as model training and prediction.
Pickle: Python library used for serializing and deserializing machine learning models.

#How to Use
Provide input values for parameters such as soil nutrient levels (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH value, rainfall, and state.
Click the "Predict" button.
The system will use the input values to make a prediction and display the recommended crop on the screen.

#Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing information about various crops and their suitability to different environmental conditions. The dataset is preprocessed and used to train the machine learning model.
